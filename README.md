# 3.-Using-particles-swarm-Optimization-PSO-for-the-optimal-positioning-of-Wind-Farm-Layout-for-the-reduction of wake loss
Wind turbines are combined in the wind farm to produce a larger amount of electrical energy. The design of the placement of the individual wind turbine within the farm has been a major challenge in wind energy production. This project presents an optimization method using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the optimal design of farm layout for the optimization of power output.

The optimal wind turbine positioning is a 2D problem that involves determining the (x,y) coordinate of each turbine in the farm for optimal power production and minimum wake losses.
The wind speed passing through the wind farm is reduced due to the wake effect which is based on the principle of conservation of momentum. Wake effect is the phenomenon that occurs when a wind turbine casts a wind shade resulting in less turbulent and slow wind speed behind the wind turbine.
The placement of wind turbines in the wind farm is primarily dependent on the wake effects within the farm and between the turbines. Wind turbines are spaced vertically and horizontally in the farm to avoid velocity deficit due to the wake effect.

This project presents an optimization method using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the optimal design of farm layout for the optimization of power output.
